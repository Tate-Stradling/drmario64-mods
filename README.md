# Dr. Mario 64 Capsule+ Mod
**Capsule+ is under active development. Expect experimental features and unstable builds.**

This is the main feature branch. I plan to merge it into the master branch when it is stable.

## Mod Overview

The goal of this fork is to create an **expanded capsule preview system**:
- While the original game only shows the next capsule coming up, the mod aims to display the **next 3â€“4 capsules**.
- This will hopefully encourage **deeper strategy** and **forward planning**, especially to **assist in attack moves** in multiplayer modes.

### Based On

This project builds on the [matching decomp of Dr. Mario 64](https://github.com/AngheloAlf/drmario64) by AngheloAlf. Please refer to their repository for additional information.

## Quick Setup

```

## Build (Condensed)
Copy your big-endian Dr Mario 64 ROM (renamed as `baserom.us.z64`) into the repository's `./config/us/` directory. Then run:

```
make setup
make lib
make extract
make

If successful, the modded ROM will be located at:
